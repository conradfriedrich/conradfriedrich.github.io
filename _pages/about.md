I'm a postdoc at the <a href="https://www.mcmp.philosophie.uni-muenchen.de/index.html">Munich Center for Mathematical Philosophy (MCMP)</a> at <a href="https://www.lmu.de/de/index.html">LMU Munich</a>.

My research focuses on epistemology and the philosophy of language. 

I'm also interested in issues in philophical logic, the philosophy of artificial intelligence, and metaphysics.

I obtained a PhD in philosophy from LMU Munich with a dissertation <a href="https://edoc.ub.uni-muenchen.de/34874/">defending a truth conditional account of communication against challenges from semantic indeterminacies,</a> supervised by <a href="https://www.mcmp.philosophie.uni-muenchen.de/people/faculty/hannes_leitgeb/index.html">Hannes Leitgeb</a> and <a href="https://www.philosophie.lmu.de/de/personenuebersicht/kontaktseite/christian-list-087028b0.html">Christian List.</a>
